Github Based Procedure

I have tried to root the impossible "not really" but if you think of it, it is indeed hard because by default the OEM UNLOCKING toggle in this phone is greyed out (which means cannot be turn on).  

Big thanks to this guy who made the impossible, possible!

```

After countless attempts, it worked!   
First thing you need is patience, common sense, strong fighting spirit, I'm telling you this procedure is so brutal!  
`You may experience the following:` 
```
Softbricked (Phone is still detected thru fastboot)
Side buttons not working properly.
```
I guarantee you 100% success afterwards.   
Just follow the steps inside that link. Goodluck!
```
My phone is Realme c11 2021 - RMX3231  
With 2gb ram and 32 gb rom
```
**Solution for buttons not working properly**  
---  
After you execute the script, it will says `usb fail` then congrats! your phone is now **SoftBricked**  
`Here's what you are going to do`   
Don't worry your phone is still detected thru `fastboot.`   

Now, try holding different combinations.   
Based on my experience, I just hold power button then plugging the usb and executing the script, voila! it worked.
