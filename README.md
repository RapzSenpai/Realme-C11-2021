Github Based Procedure
---
I have tried to root the impossible "not really" but if you think of it, it is indeed hard because by default the OEM UNLOCKING toggle in this phone is greyed out (which means cannot be turn on).  

Big thanks to this guy who made the impossible, possible!

After countless attempts, it worked!   
First thing you need is patience, common sense, strong fighting spirit, I'm telling you this procedure is so brutal!
