Github Based Procedure

I have tried to root the impossible "not really" but if you think of it, it is indeed hard because by default the OEM UNLOCKING toggle in this phone is greyed out (which means cannot be turn on).  

Big thanks to this guy who made the impossible, possible!

After countless attempts, it worked!   
First thing you need is patience, common sense, strong fighting spirit, I'm telling you this procedure is so brutal!  
You may experience the following:   
Softbricked (Phone is still detected thru fastboot)
Side buttons not working properly.
Solution if buttons not working

By default you will be holding vol down and powerbutton then execute the script. Aftet that, the script will say something like `"failed usb"`
But I guarantee you 100% success afterwards. 
Just follow the steps inside that link; Goodluck!
